As a CEO's or General Manager, you know that the teams of your organization are responsible for fulfilling all your promises and strategies; therefore, is no small feat to increase the effectiveness of our teams. After working extensively in startups, family businesses and large corporations, i find that team development is an ongoing process always worth exploring.

Here are two articles that I found that talk about a GOOGLE's research on their top performing teams and managers (Google is one of the top 10 companies to work for according to Glassdor: 

http://bit.ly/bds\_accelerator). 

These two articles were written by 

St√©phanie Thomson who is an editor at the World Economic Forum. 

This first article talks about Google's discovery of what makes effective teams. This 2 year study analyzed 180 teams in the quest for finding the dream team recipe. Here is the link to the full article

.

The second article is about the research that GOOGLE has made to find the characteristics that make a Great Manager. Through surveys, interviews and performance reviews they found 8 Skills that Google Looks for in Managers.

I would like to share with you the top 3 ideas I got out of this two articles about teams and managers if you want to stand out as leader and help your company grow:

* Work structure is very important. "Who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions." 

* Managers make a difference. "Teams with great managers were happier and more productive"

* Best Managers Develop Talent. Managers that have finished Google's training are spending up to 30% - 50% of their time helping other team members grow.

As of today start looking at your people's development as the way to become a better and top performing leader.
